# Supermarket Optimization

You are given as input:
You’ve been hired as a market consultant to try and help a local supermarket come up with better placement of items based on buyer’s preferences, and towards that goal you’d like to identify certain association rules based on existing records of buyer’s transactions. 

A transaction database—a file consisting of a single row per transaction, with individual product's SKUs given as space-separated integers. A single transaction consisting of products with SKUs 1001, 1002 and 1003 would have a line that looks like: ‘1001 1002 1003'
A minimal ’support level’ parameter, sigma – a positive integer Implement, in Python or Java, an efficient algorithm for generating all frequent item sets of size 3 or more: groups of 3 or more items that appear together in the transactions log at least as often as the support level parameter value.


For example, given a value of sigma = 2, all sets of 3 items or more that appear 2 or more times together in the transaction log should be returned. The results should be returned as a file with the following format: <item set size (N)>, <co-occurrence frequency>, <item 1 id >, <item 2 id>, …. <item N id>  Run the algorithm on the attached transaction log file and provide the results obtained for a value of sigma = 4.
